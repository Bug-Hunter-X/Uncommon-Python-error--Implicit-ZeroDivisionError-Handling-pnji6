# Uncommon Python Error: Implicit ZeroDivisionError Handling
This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Python related to how ZeroDivisionError is implicitly handled within conditional statements.

The function `function_with_uncommon_error` appears to correctly manage division by zero; however, it unexpectedly returns 0.0 instead of raising an exception. This can lead to unexpected results and makes debugging more difficult. 

The solution demonstrates how to explicitly handle exceptions using `try...except` blocks. This approach provides better error management and avoids unexpected behavior.
